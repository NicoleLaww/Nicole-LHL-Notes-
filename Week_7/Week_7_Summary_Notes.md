# Notes

## Storing Passwords Securely 
* Passwords shouldn't be encrypted, they should be hashed 
* Encryption is reversible 
* Hashing is one way 

## REST 
* In REST, the notion of Reading is split into two: (1) accessing a whole collection ("Search" or "Browse") and, (2) accessing a single member of that collection. Some developers extend CRUD to include Search, and call it SCRUD. Others think SCRUD is ugly, and instead made up a new mnemonic, BREAD, which stands for: Browse Read Edit Add Delete.
